This is my implementation of the ["Build Your Own Shell" Challenge](https://app.codecrafters.io/courses/shell/overview).

I built a simple POSIX compliant shell that can interpret shell commands, run external programs and has some building commands like cd, pwd, echo and type.

**Note**: Head over to
